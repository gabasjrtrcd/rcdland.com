  Like a garden filled with strong trees, the real estate industry has been filled with bigger companies equipped with
  deeper sources
  of funding and commercial advantages of name-recall. RCD Land was just a plain and simple company that is rooted to
  dedication and
  passion to improve the lives of Filipinos. With supportive people and team members who religiously watered this simple
  root with
  hardwork and determination, RCD Land flourished and blossomed in the industry.

  As President and CEO, Mr. Roland Delantar, expressed in his speech, “Just to survive this long in the business is
  already a tribute
  to our resiliency, our collective heart to stay in the race and to actually win our share of victories while competing
  in an industry
  dominated by corporate giants. We already made our point; we delivered our message loud and clear. Thirty-two years is
  more than
  enough proof. RCD Land is as much the product of our collective hard work as it is the outcome of your priceless
  individual contributions.”
