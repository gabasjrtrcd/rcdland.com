    A holy mass was led by Fr. Albert Guiritan, embodying the Catholic practice that signifies the protection
    of the inhabitants from unforeseen and unexpected circumstances. Subsequent to the mass, the blessing and
    ribbon-cutting of the Basketball Court, Swimming Pool, and Clubhouse transpired. Apart from these religious
    practices, throwing of candies and coins were also done to symbolize the unceasing prosperity and blessings
    within the subdivision, the people, and the whole company.
