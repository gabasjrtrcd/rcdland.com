  <strong>OPENING REMARKS</strong><br><br>
  As Arch. Rey De Leon, VP and Asset Management Head of RCD Realty Marketing Corporation have stated
  in his opening remarks, “Historically, RCD Group of Companies has gone through a lot of challenges
  such as the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, again in 2008 and many other business trials that the
  company has to endure in its quest to financial success. RCD has successfully overcome these challenges
  and that is why we thank the Almighty God that despite the pandemic making havoc in our lives
  and the economy, we are very fortunate to be blessed an opportunity to be together and celebrate
  our founding anniversary.”

  <strong>MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT</strong><br><br>
  Even with today’s crisis, RCD Land did not stop in providing its service and fulfilling the
  dreams of the Filipino People. As Mr. Roland Delantar, President and CEO of RCD Group, stated
  in his speech “We have sold 900 units since the start of pandemic crisis. This surprised me
  because it is unexpected for people to purchase houses and lots when most are struggling to
  stay at home for safety and survival. I admire you brokers and salespersons for being aggressive,
  creative, and resourceful in your desire to stay productive even if this meant withstanding the
  real threat of infection. You are heroes to your children, and I must congratulate you for your heroism.”
</p>

<p class="text-justify text-sm text-gray-600 mt-8 px-4 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
  <strong>TOUGH TIMES WILL NEVER LAST, BUT TOUGH PEOPLE DO – THAT’S WHO WE ARE AT RCD LAND</strong><br><br>
  The ongoing pandemic has disrupted many ambitions and goals while some businesses have been deemed irrelevant
  and threatened. Fortunately, in the case of RCD Land, we are very much alive and kicking. And with the light
  seem to be visible at the end of the road, the organization is indeed keen to consolidate its resources to
  come out even stronger in the coming year 2022.

  34 Years. This has been the amount of time that RCD Group has already committed to stay true to its
  promise to provide and deliver quality and affordable homes to the Filipino people. It has not been
  an easy journey with different unforeseen circumstances which has put the country’s overall economy
  under financial and health crisis, but it is definitely a road that is full of learnings, evolution,
  and dedication. RCD Group stood strong amidst these different adversities and will continue to evolve
  and progress to withstand challenges. With the help of its committed people and stakeholders, RCD will
  continue to realize dreams, create opportunities, and deliver commitments. This is because tough times
  will never last, but tough people do – and that’s who we are at RCD.
