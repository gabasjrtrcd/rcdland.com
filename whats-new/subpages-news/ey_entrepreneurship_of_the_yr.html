            The Entrepreneur of The Year Philippines is a program of the SGV Foundation Inc. that aims to recognize the
            achievements of outstanding entrepreneurs within successful, growing and dynamic businesses. The program was
            first introduced in the United States in 1986 by professional services firm Ernst and Young. At present, the
            program runs in more than 140 cities in over 50 countries. Each country sends its winner to the World
            Entrepreneur of The Year held annually in Monte Carlo.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6">
                Since its inception in 2003, the Entrepreneur of The Year Philippines program has become one of the most
                prestigious events for the local business community. The program recognizes the strength, dynamism and
                resilience of Filipino entrepreneurs who take the lead in founding and operating sustainable, successful
                enterprises. It also aims to further inspire and motivate leaders to demonstrate the winning vision,
                determination and innovative mindset that empower them to transform industries and drive social and
                economic change.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6">

                This year, the SGV Foundation is celebrating the 11th year of the program with the theme “Game
                Changers”. As reiterated by Program Director Atty. Antonette Tionko, “An entrepreneur understands that
                winning the game often means changing it for the better. Capitalizing on their strategic vision, they
                see the possibilities and opportunities that others cannot. They bring about positive transformation by
                applying creative innovation infused with dauntless determination. As game changers, entrepreneurs
                support a greater purpose, which is to improve the current business landscape.”
