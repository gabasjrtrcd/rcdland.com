      <p class="mt-6">
        As the opening remarks of RCD Land’s VP of Sales and Marketing, Mae G. Delantar, stated “2020, they say, is the year we wouldn’t want to revisit. I know it’s been a year full of challenges and uncertainties but I’m also pretty sure that amongst the chaos we have had some major learnings and breakthroughs. It was a year where we most probably had to change our thinking, shift our focus, and find new ways to do business”. Ms. Delantar has also extended her gratitude to everyone as they have displayed strong unity and teamwork to surpass business hurdles. Moreover, she assured that RCD Land is taking all the necessary measures to innovate and improve the company’s methods to ensure the business growth in the coming year.

        In line with this, all businesses and industries are faced with the challenge to adapt to the forced digitalization of the world. RCD Land is just one of the many who are committed in providing its clients and partners the same value and level of assistance as the traditional practices but this time through technology and digital tools. Hence, RCD Land is launching their first ever mobile application to streamline the homebuying process for its stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        With RCD Land’s Brooky app, sellers and clients can easily get the latest inventory, view projects and site maps, download sales kits, request for sample computations anytime and anywhere. This equips RCD sellers with the right and necessary information to close their deals faster and more efficiently. Here’s more, they can also now reserve their desired unit conveniently online through this mobile app!
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        As RCD Land’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Mae Delantar, has stated “Brooky is like having your own coordinator to assist you 24/7 at your own convenience. This will surely help our sellers to close more deals and help our buyers as well to reserve their dream homes at their own accessibility.”

       Brooky Technologies’ very own co-founder, Stephanie Uy, graced the event as a guest speaker to further equip RCD’s stakeholders regarding the specifications, capabilities, and method of RCD Land’s newest Brooky app. Ms. Uy walked everyone through the RCD Land Brooky app from how to download, to how to create their own accounts, and how to navigate the app to get their needed information through the app’s different sections and buttons.

        Valerie Fischer, a Neuro Linguistic Programming Practitioner, was also present as a guest speaker in RCD Land’s Logged-In event to discuss how to transform traditional selling to digital. The real estate industry has been known for its traditional concepts and beliefs, which made it even more challenging for its people to shift to the digital sphere of selling. It seems complicated at first but a great mindset, willingness to learn, and innovation to change indeed makes it easier to shift. This also ensures that sellers maximize the internet connection and their personal gadgets to reach more clients. Ms. Fischer gave tips and techniques to sellers on how they can transform their traditional ways of selling by maximizing digital platforms and devices to reach more clients and buyers to expand their business.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        As Ms. Fischer has stated, “The internet has democratized entrepreneurship for everybody that the power to reach clients are not enclosed to big corporations and companies but is available for all. It has empowered everyone to have a great reach of audience, in our case clients, with very little to zero expenses. The launching of the RCD Land’s brooky app makes you even luckier and widens your horizon more, given that it has equipped you with your needed information in your own mobile phones, which we have RCD Land to thank for.”
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Real estate is a big and known industry in the country and this cannot be limited to traditional concepts and practices. With the digital shift, this enables the widening of horizons for the brokers and real estate sellers to help homebuyers build their trust through the digital homebuying process by equipping them with the right and necessary information.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        With almost everything shifting to online digital platforms, RCD Land Inc. partnered with Brooky to ensure that our sellers are equipped with everything that they need in just a click of the finger. Brooky enables information to be accessible to our sellers who in turn provides the clients the best experience in reserving and purchasing their homes. More than being informative and relevant, Brooky is also very user-friendly which makes the process a whole lot easier and efficient!
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The launch of this mobile application embodies RCD Land’s commitment to provide quality and affordable homes to the Filipino people by equipping its sellers and brokers with digital tools that will provide them with the necessary information to present to their homebuyers. It also shows the company’s adaptation to today’s current situation and their continuous discovery of innovative ways to lead their stakeholders to the best practices in both selling and homebuying.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
