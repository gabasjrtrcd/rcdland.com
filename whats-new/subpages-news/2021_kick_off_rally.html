      <p class="mt-6">
        As the opening remarks of RCD Land’s VP of Sales and Marketing, Mae G. Delantar, stated “2020, they say, is the
        year we wouldn’t want to revisit. I know it’s been a year full of challenges and uncertainties but I’m also
        pretty sure that amongst the chaos we have had some major learnings and breakthroughs. It was a year where we
        most probably had to change our thinking, shift our focus, and find new ways to do business”. Ms. Delantar has
        also extended her gratitude to everyone as they have displayed strong unity and teamwork to surpass business
        hurdles. Moreover, she assured that RCD Land is taking all the necessary measures to innovate and improve the
        company’s methods to ensure the business growth in the coming year.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">LOOKING BACK YEAR 2020</h3>
      <p class="mt-6">
        2020 has been the year where everyone showed resilience. More than being resilient, RCD Land focused on giving
        back to the community and helping everyone to fight as one during this challenging year. The company donated a
        total of 400 sacks of rice on different barangays near the vicinity of its projects. The company also partnered
        with Operation Blessing Foundation Philippines, the humanitarian arm of CBN Asia, and garnered a total of
        P51,000 to give to the people greatly affected by the pandemic.

          And of course, RCD made sure to extend support to its own employees and stakeholders. Safety measures are
          improved within the office premises for its employees, financial support is given to affected employees during
          the lockdown, service transportation is also provided to ensure the employees’ safety when going to the
          office. Payment holiday was also given to suspend payment dues during the entire lockdown period, which
          immensely helped our homebuyers retain their dream homes. RCD believes that its people remain as the core of
          the business and made sure they are protected and accounted for during these uncertain times. These efforts
          helped the community and showcased the company’s dedication to uphold its promise to do its part and
          contribute to better the society.
