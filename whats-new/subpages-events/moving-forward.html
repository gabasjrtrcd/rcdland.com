  After 2 years of virtual meetings, RCD Land Inc. held its first face-to-face Staff Meeting at
  Figaro Aseana last April 29, 2022. Staff and employees graced the place and was ready to fill
  it and create fun memories with everyone! A break from the usual work routine, the RCD family
  is ready to stand and shape the future as one! Together, they will move forward.
  <br><br>
  RCD Land Inc. has always been committed to its promise to improve the lives of the Filipino
  people, and with this mission, they intend to start with the family they’ve built in the
  business which is composed of their staff and employees. Creating a strong company culture
  isn’t just a good business, but a commitment of RCD Land to its employees.
  <br><br>
  <strong>The “Love of Work” Program by Paulo Tibig</strong>
  <br><br>
  The highlight of the event was a workshop with the country’s most sought-after motivational
  speaker, Mr. Paulo Tibig. He talked about the “Love of Work” Program, stating “Remember that
  companies will always do its best for its employees, dahil mahal ka, dahil mahalaga ka. That
  is why it is just appropriate that in return, employees show MALASAKIT to the organization,
  to the customers, and to the team.”

  Tibig’s Workshop also opened the gates for the employees to share their own stories of struggles
  and victories over the past 2 years. This made way for stronger relationships within the group,
  practicing better empathy and compassion towards each other’s struggles while also lending a
  listening ear and a helping hand. More than the personal challenges, the members of the organization
  also worked towards creating a better culture and environment in the workplace by creating a
  harmonious relationship. Afterall, RCD Land is all about building homes, and they intend to
  build a home for their employees by creating a safe space for everyone.
  <br><br>
  <strong> Moving Forward as One </strong>
  <br><br>
  The Staff Meeting also tackled the year-to-date accomplishment reports of all departments. This is to
  show transparency on the status of the business across all its sectors. In addition, this embodied
  how each member of the organization should continue to deliver quality output which contribute to
  the continuous success of RCD Land as an institution, and for the company to thrive in the industry
  despite the challenges brought by the pandemic crisis.
  <br><br>
  And of course, the company’s growth is deeply rooted to the people who made it possible. RCD Land
  intends to recognize the people who have shown exemplary performance throughout the years.

    With the fulfilment of our clients’ needs is also the fulfilment of our people’s dreams.
    Thus, RCD Land continuously shows gratitude and appreciation to these people who have
    worked hard towards the company’s progression. One thing that the crisis taught us is
    the important lesson that it doesn’t matter how big or small the role that we play is,
    it is how we play our role that ultimately makes the difference. Indeed, with the right
    mindset and attitude, we will be moving forward together and will continue to stand and
    shape the future as one.
