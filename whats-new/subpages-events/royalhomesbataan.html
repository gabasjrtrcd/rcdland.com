developments are happening in the area such as the extension of the Freeport Area of Bataan (FAB), the structure of Mariveles’s 
Hall of Justice, and the construction of the 20-meter four-lane barangay road connecting to the Freeport Area of Bataan, which 
is actually conveniently-placed just in front of our property. With this, we are excited to be part of the development and launch 
RCD Royale Homes Bataan which aims to provide quality and affordable homes to the people.”
