                Last August 16, 2020, RCD land celebrated its 33rd anniversary via Online Zoom and launched a relevant
                anniversary promo that both home buyers and property sellers can participate in. Miss Mae Delantar, VP
                for Sales & Marketing proudly announced to the 450 participants that RCD land will be donating an amount
                of P1,000.00 for every reservation of RCD Land projects the entire anniversary campaign. She encouraged
                all RCD Land sales agents, brokers & in-house sellers to support the Anniversary promo to continuously
                help our kakabayans in providing them quality and affordable homes, guiding them in choosing the right
                investment, assisting them in finding a home and at the same time, become a channel of blessings to many
                people in dire of need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, Representatives of RCD Land formally awarded the said donation to Operation Blessings
                represented by (Name od OB Staffs) held in OB Head Office in Operation Blessing Foundation Phils Inc.
                5th Floor Sagittarius Bldg., HV De La Costa Salcedo Village, Makati City. This is how RCD Group is
                responding to the Covid-19 Outbreak. RCD Land management felt the moral duty to help others and
                transform lives, a sentiment very much rooted in the organization’s mission of “improving lives”.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is just a small help compared to the gravity of the situation, but we hope that we were able to
                send help and provide ease from a difficult situation to many people despite our own limitations.
            </p>
