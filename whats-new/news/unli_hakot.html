                Bernadette Tendero from Rise and Shine realty was the lucky winner of the promo. She was given 2 minutes
                to strategize within the premises of the grocery store and another 1 minute for the actual loading of
                her cart for the grocery hakot challenge. Ms. Tendero wasn’t only lucky but a great strategist as well
                because she was able to take home 32, 869 pesos worth of groceries within that 1 minute of loading her
                cart!
