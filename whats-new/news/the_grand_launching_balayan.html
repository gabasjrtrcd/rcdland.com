                celebrate the launching of our commercial lots, which is a great addition to the progressive development
                of Balayan Batangas. Given its strategic location along Balibago-Balayan Highway and its close proximity
                to commercial areas such as Supermarkets, Restaurants, Hospitals, Government Offices and upcoming Gov’t
                Infrastructure projects, RCD Royale Homes’ Commercial will definitely be a great investment for the
                business you are planning.”

                along 9-km route from the project’s site to the Balayan town proper. RCD Sellers, partner brokers, and
                trusted agents has made this activity as their avenue to give out flyers and invite people to invest in

            <p class="mt-6">
                More than the promise to improve the lives of Filipinos by providing quality and affordable homes, RCD
                Land also fosters a community that maximizes the business potential of the strategic location of its
                projects. Balayan is a fast-progressing municipality that continues to grow in population with its
                visionary developments, where economic prosperity, cultural richness, and sustainability converge.
                Hence, RCD Land aims to contribute to this success by bringing commercial spaces to aspiring business
                owners and eager investors to support the municipality's overall economic growth.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6">
                Mr. Rolando Delantar, President and CEO of RCD Land stated that, “Balayan is considered the Rising Star
                of the province of Batangas. The continuous developments of the municipality make it one of the fastest
                growing municipalities. As Balayan, Batangas, prepares to welcome a new era of commercial development,
                the opportunities for investors and businesses are boundless. Hence, the best time to invest in
                commercial lots is now and RCD Land wants to fulfill its part in nation-building through creating this
                kind of investment and business opportunities to the Filipino people.”

                The town of Balayan is considered a first-class municipality due to its progressive development. Among
                its upcoming projects is the Nasugbu-Bauan Expressway or NBEX, which connects the eastern and western
                parts of Batangas to cut travel time to and from the Metro. Following that, there is the SMC Sports
                Complex which takes part in the commitment to help develop homegrown athletes who can compete in local
                and international sports competitions, as well as promote health and wellness in the town and throughout
                the province of Batangas. There is also the Balayan Solar Power Project, a 480MW solar PV power project,
                set to commence this year. These are just great additions to the currently sought-after beaches in
                Batangas which is expected to bring more and more people and businesses in this province.
