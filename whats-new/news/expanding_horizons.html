            <p class="mt-6">
                Fulfilling its promise to improve the lives of Filipinos by providing quality and affordable homes, RCD
                Land continues to develop housing communities in locations outside Metro Manila that remain accessible
                to the city. Balayan is a fast-progressing municipality that continues to grow in population with its
                visionary developments, thus giving rise to the demand for affordable housing for its people.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6">
                Roland Delantar, President and CEO of RCD Land, Inc., stated that, “With the continuous risks of the
                pandemic, it’s indeed understandable if many of you wouldn’t come. But I was indeed surprised with how
                many of you are here with us today. It is indeed heartwarming to see all of you and I would like to
                extend my sincerest gratitude to you all.”

                He also extended his vision plan for the newest RCD Land project, “Balayan is a place of continuous
                progress and growth. Our site is just 2km away from the government center of Balayan which houses
                various offices such as the SSS, GSIS, LTO, etc. We are also very near to beaches and other tourist
                spots which makes our houses here the perfect vacation home. With this, we are excited to be part of the
                development and launch RCD Royale Homes Balayan. Our plan here is to provide bigger cuts of lot at
                120sqm for our single-detached units and we’ll also have townhouses which are the more affordable
                option. Nevertheless, all units aim to provide quality homes to the people at such reasonable prices.”
