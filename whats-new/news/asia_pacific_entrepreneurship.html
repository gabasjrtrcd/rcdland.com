            The Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards also known as APEA, is a regional recognition program organized by
            Enterprise Asia, the region’s foremost association and think-tank for entrepreneurship. The awards are
            presented to a handful of entrepreneurs across Asia Pacific each year, with award ceremonies held in over
            thirteen countries every year.
            </p>

                For its 3rd year, the APEA has recognized business leaders of Philippines as the drivers and backbone of
                Philippine economy. The recipients were selected from among 80 shortlisted candidates, ranging from
                talented young entrepreneurs to experienced industrialists. It is through this recognition program that
                Enterprise Asia hopes to continue and encourage to stimulate economic growth throughout the region.

            “We can say with certainty that the recipients of the APEA are like no other. Not only do they have to prove
            their entrepreneurial skills and experience in one of the toughest contests in the world, they also subject
            themselves to a pledge to uphold the highest standards of entrepreneurship, which includes allegiance to the
            two founding pillars of Enterprise Asia, namely Investment in People and Responsible Entrepreneurship”, said
            Dato’ William Ng, President of Enterprise Asia.

            A sequence of rigorous tests including financial verification through an appointed audit firm and a
            mandatory physical site audit and interview, culminating in a confidential balloting process by Enterprise
            Asia’s organizing committee—these are what the nominees had to go through before coming up with the final
            twenty. The final 20 are considered as the finest entrepreneurs and business leaders in the country, thus
            they are expected to be torchbearers of entrepreneurship, adhering to a strict standard of personal and
            business ethics.
