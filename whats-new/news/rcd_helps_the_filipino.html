                This 16th of August 2020, RCD Land launched a relevant advocacy promo in celebration of their 33rd
                anniversary. The event was held via Zoom with almost 500 participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mae Delantar, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, spearheaded the event announcement that RCD Land
                will be donating one thousand pesos (Php 1,000) for every reservation on any RCD Land Projects all
                throughout the anniversary campaign. She encouraged everyone to support the Anniversary promo to
                continuously help our kakabayans in guiding them in choosing the right investment, assisting them in
                finding quality and affordable homes, while simultaneously becoming a channel of blessing during these
                challenging period.

                Agents, brokers, in-house sellers, homebuyers, and all stakeholders can take part in this advocacy
                movement. It is an embodiment of RCD Land’s efforts to enable a platform wherein everyone can show and
                give support during this time of crisis. Fulfilling our dreams is already something we all want to
                achieve, but instigating change and assistance by fulfilling your dreams is what RCD Land advocates for.

                Last November 2020, Representatives of RCD Land formally awarded the said donation to Operation
                Blessings held in their Head Office in Operation Blessing Foundation Phils Inc. 5th Floor Sagittarius
                Bldg., HV De La Costa Salcedo Village, Makati City. RCD Land garnered fifty-one thousand pesos (P51,000)
                from all unit reservations from duration of the anniversary campaign. Rooted to the company’s mission to
                continuously improve lives, this step is RCD Group’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak which aims to
                help the Filipino people to rise as one.

            <p class="mt-6">
                This is just a small help compared to the gravity of the situation, but the aim for this is to create
                ripples of hope to the Filipino people during these uncertain times. RCD Land enables a platform to
                extend help which shows how it stays committed to its promise to continuously improve lives, deeply
                rooted to serve and help people further than its business and organizational goals.
