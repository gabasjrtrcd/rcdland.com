                the multiplier effect, the evolving lifestyle preference, the omnipresence to generate leads, and the
                access and availability of loan facilities. More than this, he encouraged everyone to develop and
                attitude and habit to be productive and to always go back to their “bakit” list or their purpose for
                their hustle. And of course, to master the craft of selling, it’s always essential to patronize and know
                your own product so sellers can equip their clients with the necessary information they need.

                The ongoing pandemic has disrupted many ambitions and goals while some businesses have been deemed
                irrelevant and threatened. Fortunately, in the case of RCD Land, the company stayed relevant and is
                continuously innovating to withstand challenges. The company has developed a culture of success and
                winners among its members and with the light seem to be visible at the end of the road, the organization
                is indeed keen to consolidate its resources to come out even stronger this year.

            <p class="mt-6">
                As RCD Group’s President and CEO, Mr. Roland Delantar, stated, “We have already seen the worst in
                financial crisis, notably the financial crisis in 1997, the global financial crisis in 2007, and lately
                the 2020 financial crisis as a consequence of the pandemic. I thank GOD for giving RCD Group the chance
                to survive these global crises and I pray that no more of these will come in the future. Having
                experience several financial crises and survived them all give us a sense of confidence and enthusiasm
                as we look forward to the future. We at RCD have already prepared plans and projections for the year
                2022 and beyond. We’ll be in full blast not only this year but even in the upcoming years. We are very
                determined to face the future very aggressively. There’s so much in store for RCD in the next 5 years.”
            </p>


            <p class="mt-6">
                Realizing dreams, creating opportunities, and delivering commitments – these remain as RCD’s vision and
                purpose, and they continue to stay true to these promises. Even with the obstacles and adversities
                brought by the global pandemic, RCD Land stood strong and utilized these trials as their wings to become
                stronger, better, and bolder. They have gone through a radical shift to equip their stakeholders and
                have now become even more determined to go on a full blast with a revolutionized purpose and vision in
                2022.
