      A company who grows through achieving your dreams, 
      RCD Land Inc. is a real estate development company 
      who makes your dream home come to life. A heart to 
      create and a passion to improve the lives of Filipinos 
      drive us to build quality and affordable homes in a community
      which enables the ideal lifestyle for our homeowners.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify mb-6">
      We believe that everyone deserves their own home—impelling 
      us to create affordable houses for the middle-segment to 
      low-segment earners. Our purpose goes beyond building communities
      but also to contribute in solving the pressing issue of the 
      growing housing backlog in the Philippines and to help relieve 
      the congestion of Metro Manila. Realizing the great opportunities 
      and fast development of the neighboring provinces of the Metro, 
      RCD Land Inc. focuses on building communities in Cavite, Batangas, 
      Bulacan, Batac, and Quezon which remain easily accessible from the city.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify mb-6">
      Through our more than 30 years of experience in the industry, 
      RCD Land Inc. continues to grow and evolve with the market by 
      acknowledging the demand for less expensive homes. The rise of 
      the middle-income segment, the increase in the number of people
      considering to move to provinces next to the cities, and the 
      continued infrastructure development through the Build-Build-Build 
      (BBB) Program have a huge impact on driving retail demand in Real 
      Estate. Thus, this gives an opportunity for us to continue in working
      on our mission and to focus on delivering houses outside Metro Manila 
      that are of quality yet affordable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      A professional management team with years of combined experience
      in real estate development and field of expertise empowers our
      success. Through our sustained team effort, we aim to become 
      one of the market leaders in the affordable housing segment 
      which continues to motivate and drive our employees, stakeholders
      and valued clients.

        RCD LAND INC. - Since 1987
      </div>
      <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 text-sm text-justify">
        <p>
          The leadership and success of RCD Land Inc. roots from a humble beginning.
          Our founder, Roland C. Delantar, was just a simple man from Leyte who had big
          dreams and vision. Determination and passion were his only assets when he started
          this journey. With a single table and a telephone to call as his office,
          Mr. Delantar started his own real estate brokerage company in 1987. This company,
          RCD Realty Corporation, focuses on marketing affordable housing projects for big
          developers. Under the management of our founder, Mr. Delantar, RCD Realty Corporation
          grew and became part of the top marketing companies of 17 developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the company's success and realized opportunities in the real estate industry,
          we evolved into a housing contractor for single-unit projects and small pocket
          developments by the year 1997. The whole Asia experienced a financial crisis by the
          same year, putting the company in a more challenging state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, we stood strong and firm with our mission to help people achieve their dreams.
          The real estate industry came to a rebound and grew immensely by the year 2000, enabling us
          to continue with our mission and expand the business further. With a heart and vision to improve
          the lives of Filipinos by building affordable and quality homes, RCD Land Inc. ventured into becoming
          a full-pledge housing developer in 2005. Our blueprint for housing is more than just providing quality
          and affordable homes, it encompasses the passion to improve the lives of the Filipinos by creating
          masterfully-planned residential projects in an environment that creates a balanced lifestyle for the homeowners.
          RCD Land Inc's success continues and plays an active and vital role in the real estate industry as
          a comprehensive real estate development enterprise that provides quality yet affordable homes to every Filipino.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vital to our success is a dynamic and highly-responsive network of brokers and agents who help potential
          buyers find the perfect home. Maintaining a relationship with over 500 brokers, RCD Land Inc. ensures that
          these people contribute and uplift the company's mission and vision of improving lives while their lives are
          also being improved. As a company who started as a marketing arm which grew and evolved, we understand and
          realize the needs and aspirations of both our sellers and clients. Thus, RCD Land Inc. continues to help these
          people in achieving their dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, RCD Land Inc. is a company with over 100 professional and experienced employees who continue to empower
          our success. From a single table and a telephone, our company now has 7 offices all-over Luzon with our main
          office located in Parañaque and 6 branch offices in Makati, Laguna, Batangas, Cavite, Pampanga, and Bulacan.
          With more than 5,000 housing units built on almost 100 hectares of land in 5 different provinces, our company
          stands strong to fulfill our mission to improve the lives of our fellow Filipinos while continuously working
          on our vision to be one of the market leaders in the real estate industry.
